Calculator by Alik Balika

This calculator project contains 3 packages. It follows the MVC design pattern.

The model package contains 11 classes. There is an abstract Number class which is a superclass for the Binary, Hex, and
Decimal classes. There are 3 enums that contains the names of specific data units and their appropriate factors.
Then there is an abstract Unit class which takes in a generic type of one of the 3 enums to instantiate it. The Unit
class has 3 subclasses which are SizeUnit, RateUnit, and FrequencyUnit.

The view package contains 8 classes. 2 of the classes actually run the program. The first is Main which is displaying
the CLI and using all the classes in order to run the program. It displays an introductory message and the main menu,
and sub menus, etc. The second class that can run the program is MainGUI which is a class that actually runs the
GUI and sets up the frame/basic components of the frame. MainGUI adds an instance of TabbedPane which is a component
that adds tabs to the frame with panels. The TabbedPane then has 4 separate instances of different classes that are
BinaryPanel, HexPanel, BandwidthPanel, and FilePanel. Each class is a panel with their appropriate calculations
displayed which the user can interact with. The final class is the CalculateFile class. This class has one method that
takes in a String and if it is a valid File, it will scan the file and do all the necessary calculations and output
it to a new File.

The controller package does all of the calculations. There are 9 classes in the controller package. It contains an
abstract Calculator class that has three subclasses (BinaryCalculator, HexCalculator, DecimalCalculator) which each deal
with their specific data types. It also contains a Convertible interface which the Binary, Hex, and Decimal classes
implement. The last three classes (DownloadUploadTimeCalculator, WebsiteBandwidthCalculator, Converter) deal with
calculations with download/upload time, converting one unit to another, and calculating the website bandwidth.
